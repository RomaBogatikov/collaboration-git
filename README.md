1. Set up the file tree with controllers/models/views and server.js with empty files.

2. If working off of a forked repo and need to pull from remote repo it is easier to name the remote repo (in class our remote repo is named upstream):
'git remote add sebastian https://github.com/sdarena/collaboration-git.git'

3. To pull from remote repo:
'git pull remote-branch-name(upstream, sebastian) local-branch-name(master, dev)'
